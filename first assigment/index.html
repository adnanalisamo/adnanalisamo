            A map outlining historical sites in Pakistan
            The history of Pakistan preceding the country's independence in 1947[1] 
            is shared <br> with that of Afghanistan, India, and Iran. Spanning the western
            expanse of the Indian subcontinent and the eastern borderlands 
            of the Iranian plateau, the region of present-day Pakistan served
            both as the fertile ground of a major civilization and as the
            gateway of South Asia to Central Asia and the Near East.[2][3]
            
            Situated on the first coastal migration route of Homo sapiens out
            of Africa, the region was inhabited early by modern humans.[4][5]
            The 9,000-year history of village life in South Asia traces back 
            to the Neolithic (7000–4300 BCE) site of Mehrgarh in Pakistan,
           [6][7][8] and the 5,000-year history of urban life in South Asia to the various sites of the Indus Valley Civilization, including Mohenjo Daro and Harappa.[9][10]
            
            Following the decline of the Indus valley civilization, Indo-Aryan 
            tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of 
            migration in the Vedic Period (1500–500 BCE), bringing with them
            came their distinctive religious traditions and practices which 
            fused with local culture.[11] The Indo-Aryans religious beliefs
            and practices from the Bactria–Margiana culture and the native
            Harappan Indus beliefs of the former Indus Valley Civilisation
            eventually gave rise to Vedic culture and tribes.[12][note 1]
            Most notable among them was Gandhara civilization, which
            flourished at the crossroads of India, Central Asia, and
            the Middle East, connecting trade routes and absorbing 
            cultural influences from diverse civilizations.[14] The
            initial early Vedic culture was a tribal, pastoral society
            centred in the Indus Valley, of what is today Pakistan.
            During this period the Vedas, the oldest scriptures of 
            Hinduism, were composed.[note 2]
            
            The ensuing millennia saw the region of present-day Pakistan 
            absorb many influences—represented among others in the ancient,
            mainly Hindu-Buddhist, sites of Taxila, and Takht-i-Bahi, the 
            14th-century Islamic-Sindhi monuments of Thatta, and the 
            17th-century Mughal monuments of Lahore. In the first half
            nof the 19th century, the region was appropriated by the East 
            India Company, followed, after 1857, by 90 years of direct British
            rule, and ending with the creation of Pakistan in 1947, through
            the efforts, among others, of its future national poet 
            Allama Iqbal and its founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Since 
            then, the country has experienced both civilian-democratic
            and military rule, resulting in periods of significant economic
            and military growth as well as those of instability; significant
            during the latter, was the secession of East Pakistan as the
            new nation of Bangladesh.</p>
