        <h3>History of Punjab </h3>


 <p>     Punjab (/pʌnˈdʒɑːb/; Punjabi, Urdu: پنجاب, pronounced [pəɳˈdʒɑːb]
     ⓘ; abbr. PB) is a province of Pakistan.
         Located in central-eastern region of the country, Punjab is the
          second-largest province of Pakistan by land
         area and the largest by population. Lahore is the capital and the largest
          city of the province. Other major
         cities include Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Multan.

         It is bordered by the Pakistani provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the
          north-west, Balochistan to the
         south-west and Sindh to the south, as well as Islamabad Capital Territory
          to the north-west and Azad Kashmir
         to the north. It shares an international border with the Indian states of 
         Rajasthan and Punjab to the east
         and Indian-administered Kashmir to the north-east. Punjab is the most
          fertile province of the country as
         River Indus and its four major tributaries Ravi, Jhelum, Chenab and Sutlej 
         flow through it.

         The province forms the bulk of the transnational Punjab region, now divided
          among Pakistan and India.[7] The
         provincial capital is Lahore — a cultural and cosmopolitan centre of Pakistan.
          Punjab is also the world's
         fifth-most populous subnational entity, and the most populous outside of China
          and India.

         Punjab is Pakistan's most industrialized province, with the industrial sector
          comprising 24 percent of the
         province's gross domestic product.[8] It is known for its relative 
         prosperity,[9] and has the lowest rate of
         poverty among all Pakistani provinces.[10][b] However, a clear divide is 
         present between the northern and
         southern regions of the province;[9] with northern Punjab being more
          prosperous than south Punjab.[11][12]
         Punjab is also one of the most urbanized regions of South Asia, with
          approximately 40 percent of its
         population being concentrated in urban areas.[13]

        The Punjabic peoples are native to the province, comprising over 90 
        percent of the total population. The
         culture of Punjab has been strongly influenced by Sufism, with numerous
          Sufi shrines spread across the
         province.[14] Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, was born in the town
          of Nankana Sahib, near
         Lahore.[15][16][17] Punjab is also the site of the Katas Raj Temples,
          which feature prominently in Hindu
         mythology.[18] Several of the World Heritage Sites listed by UNESCO are 
         located in Punjab, including the
         Shalimar Gardens, the Lahore Fort, the archaeological excavations at Taxila,
          and the Rohtas Fort, among
         others.[19] </p>
