    <h3>History of Sindh </h3>

    <p> The history of Sindh refers to the history of the Pakistani province of Sindh,
         as well as neighboring regions that periodically came under its sway.

    Sindh was the site of one of the Cradle of civilizations, the Bronze Age Indus
     Valley civilisation that flourished from about 3000 B.C. and declined rapidly
     1,000 years later, following the Indo-Aryan migrations that overran the
     region in waves between 1500 and 500 B.C.[1] The migrating Indo-Aryan 
     tribes gave rise to the Iron Age vedic civilization, which lasted till
     500 BC. During this era, the Vedas, the oldest and primary Hindu
     scriptures were composed. In 518 BC, the Achaemenid empire conquered
     Indus valley and established Hindush satrapy in Sindh. Following
     Alexander the Great's invasion, Sindh became part of the Mauryan
     Empire. After its decline, Indo-Greeks, Indo-Scythians and
     Indo-Parthians ruled in Sindh.
        
     Sindh is sometimes referred to as the Bab-ul Islam 
     (transl.â€‰'Gateway of Islam'), as it was one of the first regions of the Indian
     subcontinent to fall under Islamic rule. Parts of the modern-day province 
     were intermittently subject to raids by the Rashidun army during the early
     Muslim conquests, but the region did not fall under Muslim rule until the 
     Arab invasion of Sind occurred under the Umayyad Caliphate, headed 
     Muhammad ibn Qasim in 712 CE.[2][3] Afterwards, Sindh was ruled by 
     a series of dynasties including Habbaris, Soomras, Sammas, Arghuns 
     and Tarkhans. The Mughal empire conquered Sindh in 1591 and organized
     it as Subah of Thatta, the first-level imperial division. Sindh again
     became independent under Kalhora dynasty. The British conquered Sindh
     in 1843 AD after Battle of Hyderabad from the Talpur dynasty. Sindh 
     became separate province in 1936, and after independence became part
     of Pakistan.</p>
